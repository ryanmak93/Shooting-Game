# Shooting-Game

2 player shooting game on Arduino. 

Requirements:
2 Potentiometer
2 Buttons
LCD
Bluetooth Module
LED Matrix 8x8

I also made an app to communicate with the game via bluetooth using MIT App Inventor 2. Use it to change game settings and start the game. This also uses the LedControl library, which can be found on https://github.com/wayoda/LedControl. 

Player stand on opposite sides of the matrix. Players can move left and right and shoot. When hit, the player loses a life. The game ends when the life count or time runs out.
